          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Examined variables (Health Risks and Age, Income)</h2>
          <p>Analyzing the relationship between poverty and healthcare shortage, there was a positive correlation.
            the increase in the level of poverty, affected the percentage of individual access to healthcare. 
            above conclusion has drawn from the notable analysis between the state poverty rate and population acesses to healthcare benefits. 
          </p>

          <p>Also in comparison of the state madian household and the healthcare access, has proved that there is relationship and postive corelation 
            between state uninsured resident and low household income. so the lower the household income within the state, the 
            lower accesses to healthcare benefits, the higher health issues such as obesity. 
            
          </p>

          <p>Also on a different analytical point, we can conclude thatb Age vs. Smokes within majority of the states increase
            at the middle of chart, which conclude that most states have similar correlation when we analyze age and smoking, which 
            quarter of each state population smokes between the median ages of 36-40.
